# collatz-functional-divergence
# an Interactive HTML to show and understand collatz-functional-divergence 
# backed as help by 2 Murgu 1D Array Everyone Handled by a Proper Javascript as to obtain separate message.
# Project For Future as 
# Murgu 1D Array - Theoretic can be extended to "Infinity Per 6" by an Javascript Generator. 
# We are limited now and into future by our Computational Power - but - 
# Computational Power Evolution can be linked now to Murgu 1D Array as METER and TESTER.
# Functional Divergence maybe heavy task 
# maybe important only for H_Intel proud state as 
# Collatz Conjecture is Solved 
# By Marker USA Murgu Arrows 
# Guarded By Collatz Conjecture Murgu Formulas 
# Collatz Conjecture Group Thory Murgu Inverse Method 
# And ENd into New Science Tool 
# Collatz Conjecture As 1D Array - Murgu 1D Array
#  ***
# Collatz Conjecture Functional Divergence May Be even for GitHub only a Proud Gesture , But to stand With GitHub for!
# Here is an Interactive HTML Guarded by 2 Javascipt handlers Using to Murgu 1D Array 
# First Murgu 1D Array Cover Integers between [1,23999] - Second [1,47999]
# Chosing an Odd Integers placed into first array (good example 22333) first Javascript alert message will show Collatz Odds Patterns for
# Second Javascript also - 
# As Final scope is to image and analyze Collatz Functional Divergence - Will see For Any Integers into first array messages are different.
# We chose "alert" as to be faster and to can copy and paste for Analytic. 
# ***
# Murgu 1D Array can be Infinity Per 6 as Index - impossible computational - but - we can approach by using BigInt and transform Javascript Handler, to handle multiple Murgu 1D Array.
