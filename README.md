# Collatz Conjecture is Solved 
# By Marker USA Murgu Arrows 
# Guarded By Collatz Conjecture Murgu Formulas 
# Collatz Conjecture Group Thory Murgu Inverse Method 
# And ENd into New Science Tool 
# Collatz Conjecture As 1D Array - Murgu 1D Array

# Collatz Conjecture Functional Divergence May Be even for GitHub only a Proud Gesture , But to stand With GitHub for!
# Here is an Interactive HTML Guarded by 2 Javascipt handlers Using to Murgu 1D Array 
# First Murgu 1D Array Cover Integers between [1,23999] - Second [1,47999]
# Chosing an Odd Integers placed into first array (good example 22333) first Javascript alert message will show Collatz Odds Patterns for
# Second Javascript also - 
# As Final scope is to image and analyze Collatz Functional Divergence - Will see For Any Integers into first array messages are different.
# We chose "alert" as to be faster and to can copy and paste for Analytic. 
# ***
# Murgu 1D Array can be Infinity Per 6 as Index - impossible computational - but - we can approach by using BigInt and transform Javascript Handler, to handle multiple Murgu 1D Array.
