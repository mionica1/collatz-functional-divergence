## What this is
- A browser-based visualization (HTML/JS) to help understand patterns related to Collatz behavior.
- Uses JavaScript to generate and display sequences/messages based on the Murgu 1D Array concept.
- Intended as a foundation for future extensions (e.g., a generator toward an “infinity per 6” idea).
